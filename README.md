The dataset includes information such as age, gender, demographics, interests, device type, and more.
With over 10,000 data points, it provided a rich source of information for analysis and modeling.
Model Building and Evaluation:
I trained three regression models: Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Baseline Model.
Evaluated the models using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to measure their predictive performance.
Model Performance:
Random Forest Regressor:
MSE: 6.445
MAE: 2.160
Gradient Boosting Regressor (Best Model):
MSE: 6.426
MAE: 2.129
Baseline Model:
MSE: 6.335
MAE: 2.135
